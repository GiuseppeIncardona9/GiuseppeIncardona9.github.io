My expertise spans Python, R, SQL and various programming frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as advanced data visualisation tools including Tableau and PowerBI.

My professional journey began as a Business Analyst Apprentice at Intesa Sanpaolo Group in Milan, where I significantly improved risk assessment processes and data analysis efficiency, achieving a 20% reduction in operational risks. Progressing to a Junior Data Scientist role at Alkemy, I spearheaded data management for over 200 startup companies and developed predictive models that increased customer engagement.

At SOHO House UK Ltd in London, I leveraged advanced analytics to enhance customer engagement, achieving a 15% increase in seasonal sales and a 10% reduction in churn through predictive modelling.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have engaged in over 16 projects, applying knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP), both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and diverse data modeling approaches.
