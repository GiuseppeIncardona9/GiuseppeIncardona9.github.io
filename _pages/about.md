👨‍💻 I am a Business Analytics postgraduate student at Bayes Business School (formerly CASS)

🤩 Thrilled to use my expertise to help organisations make data-driven decisions

📚 I am currently working towards my master's research project, which involves developing an identity resolution framework. This framework matches over 1.1 million Linux Kernel emails to contributors using ML and NLP, crafting algorithms that analyze coding styles and discussion patterns to enhance contributor identification in large-scale open-source project

🛫 When I'm not analyzing data, I enjoy socialising, traveling, reading, playing games and researching market trends. I speak English, Italian and French at an intermediate level
