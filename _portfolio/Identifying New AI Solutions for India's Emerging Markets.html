title: "Identifying New AI Solutions for India's Emerging Markets"
excerpt: "In this project, I analysed startup funding in India from 2017 to 2021, focusing on the roles of location and sector. Using Multiple Imputation by Chained 
Equations (MICE) to handle missing data, I discovered significant impacts from global events like the COVID-19 pandemic on startup trends, particularly in technology and fintech
sectors. Bengaluru stood out as a major funding hub. Recommendations for startups include targeting high-growth areas, developing a viable product, and forming a strong team to

In this project, I analysed key factors influencing startup funding in emerging markets, specifically focusing on India, and developed strategies to enhance startups' attractiveness to investors. I utilised five years of startup funding data (2017-2021) to uncover patterns and trends that affect investment decisions, particularly highlighting the importance of location and industry sector in securing investments.

To address data integrity issues, I employed Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) to handle missing values, ensuring a robust and reliable analysis with minimal data loss. This method allowed me to categorize the nature of missing data into Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR), guiding the selection of the most appropriate imputation strategy.

The findings indicate noticeable fluctuations in the emergence and funding of startups, with significant impacts stemming from global occurrences like the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis reveals that sectors such as technology and fintech attract considerable investments, and cities like Bengaluru are leading in funding amounts, underscoring the strong regional influence on investment trends.

I outlined strategic recommendations for startups seeking to draw investor interest, stressing the importance of aligning with favorable locations and sectors, and showcasing potential through a minimum viable product. I advocate for building a capable team and customizing pitches to various funding stages to enhance the likelihood of securing investments, in line with the successful trends observed within the startup ecosystem.
