This project involves the development of a comprehensive analytical tool aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural production. It utilises a dataset containing parameters such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH and rainfall to study their impacts on various crop yields. The project integrates various data science techniques, including data visualisation, interactive data manipulation and machine learning models, to predict optimal growing conditions for different crops based on environmental inputs. The system helps in decision-making for the company by suggesting the most suitable crops for cultivation under given climatic conditions, thus aiming to maximise agricultural output and sustainability.
