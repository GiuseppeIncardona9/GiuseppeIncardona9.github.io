title: "Optimisation of Price and Menu Assortment for a UK Pizza Restaurant Chain"
excerpt: "The aim of this project was to enhance the profitability of a UK-based pizza chain facing financial challenges. I developed a comprehensive pricing strategy that includes dynamic pricing, tailored pricing for students, and menu assortment optimization. Utilising simulated consumer data, the strategy focuses on optimising prices for peak and non-peak periods and special student rates. I used techniques like demand modeling, linear regression and optimization models to adjust pricing and menu offerings strategically, aiming to maximise revenue and ensure operational efficiency in response to economic pressures. <br/><img src='/images/pizza.webp'>"

This project focuses on enhancing the profitability of a UK-based pizza chain. Amid financial challenges caused by inflation, wage increases, and the impacts of 
the pandemic, I developed a comprehensive pricing strategy and optimal menu assortment. This strategy includes dynamic and tailored pricing for different times and customer 
segments (students vs. non-students), menu assortment optimisation using Markov Chain and Multinomial Logit (MNL) models, and markdown optimisation for seasonal specials.
The approach uses simulated survey data to analyse consumer willingness to pay, optimising prices for peak and non-peak periods, and for student-specific pricing. 
I employed several technical analysis methods, including demand modelling, linear regression, nonlinear optimisation and sensitivity analysis to fine-tune the menu offerings and 
pricing strategies to maximise revenue while ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The ultimate goal is to boost the financial health of the company by 
strategically adjusting pizza prices and assortments, thereby ensuring the chain's growth and sustainability in a competitive market. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/GiuseppeIncardona9/Data-Driven-Projects/tree/main/Pizza%20Pilgrims%20Price%20Optimisation)
