This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and visualisation of YouTube channels across various global regions. This analysis highlights the distribution of YouTube channels by country and content category, examining the disparities and cultural influences on content popularity. It also explores the differences in annual earnings among channels across content categories and how socioeconomic factors influence content preferences on YouTube.

Key insights include the dominance of the United States in channel numbers, the significant earnings of entertainment and music categories, and regional differences in content preference driven by socioeconomic backgrounds. The project also investigates growth trends among new versus established channels, identifying rapid growth opportunities in newer channels, especially in popular categories like Entertainment and People & Blogs.

Furthermore, the study analyses top-performing channels to identify common characteristics that contribute to their success, such as posting frequency and production values, and examines the impact of subscriber counts on video views and earnings, establishing a statistically significant relationship that underscores the importance of subscriber count in predicting channel performance and financial success.
